# 🐌 SlimeShadies NFT Project

Welcome to **SlimeShadies** — a collection of 10,000 uniquely generated snail-themed NFTs that slithered onto the Avalanche blockchain!

## 🧬 About the Project

SlimeShadies began as an experimental NFT collection designed to showcase creativity, technical depth, and community-first commitment. Every snail was randomly generated from a pool of hand-crafted traits, ensuring each one is as quirky and unique as the next.

Half of the collection was sold out during the initial launch. While the original roadmap milestones required a full sellout for further development, the SlimeShadies team believed in delivering more than just promises — so we went ahead and built the ecosystem anyway.

## 🚀 Features & Milestones

Despite challenges, SlimeShadies delivered a complete and evolving ecosystem:

### ✅ **NFT Staking**
Holders can stake their snails and earn passive rewards in the form of our utility token, `$SHADY`.

### 💰 **$SHADY Token**
A utility token designed to power the SlimeShadies ecosystem, enabling staking rewards, game participation, and future upgrades.

### 🎟️ **On-Chain Lottery**
A fully self-developed lottery system was introduced to reward the community. Due to limited resources, the lottery uses **pseudo-random number generation** (PRNG) instead of VRF-based true randomness, but still remains provably fair and transparent.

### 🐌💨 **Racing Game**
An NFT-powered racing game where your SlimeShadies snails can compete for prizes and bragging rights! Just like the lottery, the game’s outcome is determined via pseudo-random mechanics for efficient, on-chain results.

## ⚙️ Smart Contract Architecture

The SlimeShadies smart contracts were designed with flexibility and future-proofing in mind:

- **Minter Contract Separation**  
  The minting logic was decoupled from the core NFT contract, allowing seamless extensions and upgrades.
  
- **NFT Extensions & Boosters**  
  This design allowed us to introduce **NFT Boosters** — add-on metadata or utility items for your snails — as well as **1/1 Special NFTs** that were distributed as rewards for community events and Discord competitions.

## 💚 Community First

From the very beginning, SlimeShadies was built around a dedicated community. Even without reaching initial funding goals, we delivered beyond the roadmap, driven by creativity, passion, and the support of our holders.
